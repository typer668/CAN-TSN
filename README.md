# CAN-TSN
Storage of desensitized CAN-TSN test datasets:  The frame priorities of each CAN channel are reordered from high to low (i.e., CAN IDs arranged in ascending order).  Only the frame lengths are retained, while the data field contents are removed (can be considered as filled with all zeros).
